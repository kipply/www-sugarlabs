This repository code base was used for the development of the GSOC 2017 project **Giving Sugar Labs Website a New Look** under the organization **Sugar Labs**. The changes made during the **GSOC** period can be viewed at [https://github.com/sugarlabs/www-sugarlabs/issues/63](https://github.com/sugarlabs/www-sugarlabs/issues/63). The repository of the original website is located at [https://github.com/sugarlabs/www-sugarlabs](https://github.com/sugarlabs/www-sugarlabs). The work during **GSOC** was done in the repository [https://github.com/geekrypter/sugarLabsWebsiteRedesign](https://github.com/geekrypter/sugarLabsWebsiteRedesign). A live preview of the website is hosted using **Github pages** and can be viewed at [https://geekrypter.github.io/sugarLabsWebsiteRedesign/](https://geekrypter.github.io/sugarLabsWebsiteRedesign/).
